# Urbanix App

## Overview
Urbanix is a modern application designed to streamline the process of buying and selling properties. Built using the MERN stack for web development and React Native for mobile platforms, Urbanix offers users a seamless experience across various devices. This Git repository serves as the central hub for the development, collaboration, and version control of the Urbanix project.

## Key Features
- **Property Listings:** Browse through a vast collection of properties available for sale or rent, filtered by location, price range, and property type.
- **User Authentication:** Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms ensure that only authenticated users can access certain features, such as adding properties for sale or contacting sellers.
- **Interactive Maps:** Integration with mapping services provides users with a visual representation of property locations, nearby amenities, and neighborhood insights.
- **Real-time Chat:** Facilitate communication between buyers and sellers through a real-time messaging system, enabling negotiation and clarification of property details.
- **Favorites and Notifications:** Users can save their favorite properties for later viewing and receive notifications for new listings matching their preferences.
- **Payment Gateway Integration:** Seamless integration with popular payment gateways allows users to make secure transactions directly through the app.
- **Admin Dashboard:** An intuitive dashboard empowers administrators to manage listings, user accounts, and reported content efficiently.

## Repository Structure
### Backend (MERN Stack):
- `/server`: Contains server-side code written in Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
- `/models`: Data models and schemas for MongoDB collections.
- `/routes`: API routes for handling various HTTP requests.
- `/controllers`: Logic for handling API requests and interfacing with the database.
- `/config`: Configuration files for environment variables, database connections, etc.
- `/middleware`: Custom middleware functions for request processing and authentication.
- `/tests`: Unit and integration tests for ensuring code quality and reliability.
- `/scripts`: Automation scripts for deployment, database seeding, etc.

### Frontend (React Native):
- `/client`: Contains client-side code written in React Native for iOS and Android platforms.
- `/src/components`: Reusable React components for building the user interface.
- `/src/screens`: Individual screens representing different views and functionalities of the app.
- `/src/utils`: Utility functions, helper classes, and constants used throughout the frontend code.
- `/src/styles`: Global stylesheets and theme configurations for consistent UI styling.
- `/src/context`: React context providers for managing global state and user authentication.

## Development Workflow
1. **Feature Branches:** Developers create feature branches for each new feature or bug fix, following a descriptive naming convention (e.g., `feature/add-property-listing`, `bugfix/user-authentication`).
2. **Pull Requests:** Once development is complete, developers submit pull requests from their feature branches to the `develop` branch for review.
3. **Code Reviews:** Peer code reviews are conducted to ensure code quality, adherence to coding standards, and proper implementation of features.
4. **Continuous Integration:** Automated tests are run using CI/CD pipelines to validate changes and prevent regressions before merging into the main branches.
5. **Release Branches:** When a set of features is ready for release, a release branch is created from `develop` for final testing and deployment.
6. **Deployment:** After successful testing, changes are merged into the `master` branch and deployed to production environments.
